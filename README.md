# SpaceHack-Project by Phoenix Squad
During the exciting 24-hour offline Spacehack hackathon, hosted by Esya IIITD, my two colleagues and I embarked on a journey into the captivating realm of exoplanets. Using powerful tools like Machine Learning and the vast resources available on Kaggle, we aimed to create a strong and reliable model to uncover new insights in this fascinating field.

The hackathon provided us with a unique opportunity to collaborate and pool our expertise to tackle complex challenges. With our shared passion for space exploration and data science, we dove deep into the data available on exoplanets, seeking patterns, trends, and potential discoveries.

Utilizing machine learning techniques, we analyzed vast datasets containing information about exoplanets, such as their orbital characteristics, size, and composition. By applying advanced algorithms and models, we aimed to identify hidden patterns and predict properties of exoplanets with accuracy.

Throughout the intense 24-hour hackathon, we worked tirelessly, experimenting with different approaches, fine-tuning our models, and refining our strategies. The collaborative spirit among team members fueled our creativity and determination, driving us to push the boundaries of what was possible.

As the hackathon concluded, we were proud to have developed a robust machine learning model that showcased our dedication, teamwork, and passion for exploration. Our journey into the world of exoplanets not only yielded valuable insights but also fostered lasting friendships and memories.

The Spacehack hackathon served as a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and exploration. It provided a platform for like-minded individuals to come together, unleash their creativity, and contribute to the collective pursuit of knowledge and discovery in the vast expanse of space.
